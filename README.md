## 🚀 How It Works

### 🔬 Formula for Body Fat Percentage:
Based on [BMI-based estimation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019055/):

- For men:  
  `Body Fat % = 1.20 × BMI + 0.23 × Age − 16.2`

- For women:  
  `Body Fat % = 1.20 × BMI + 0.23 × Age − 5.4`

Where:  
`BMI = weight (kg) / (height in m)²`
